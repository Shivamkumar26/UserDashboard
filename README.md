# USER's DASHBOARD 📅

###  Website is live at [Demo](https://) 🖥

When a user clicks the `display` button and selects a grouping option, the Dashboard **dynamically adjusts** to reflect the user's choice.


## 📍 WORKING :
#### The application offers *three distinct ways* to group the data:

**By Status:** Group tickets based on their current status.

**By User:** Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.

**By Priority:** Group tickets based on their priority level.

#### Users should also be able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:
**Priority:** Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.

**Title:** Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.
